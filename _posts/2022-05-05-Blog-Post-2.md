title: IMDB Scraper
---

In this blog post, we are going to create a scraper that scrapes information from the IMDB website.  Here is a link to the repository with this code:  https://github.com/NicholasDelianedis/HW2Scrape

## ยง1. Write a Scraper

We will start by importing the required modules, specifically scrapy.

```python
import scrapy
from scrapy.http import Request
```

Next, we will create our class to put our parse functions to scrape the website.  We will start by adding a name, in this case 'imdb_spider', which we will call our spider, and we have a list called start_urls which in this case contains one IMDB url that we will use to start our scrape.

```python
class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/']

```

Now, we will create three parse functions in this class.  The first function will be called 'parse', and will direct the scraper to the full credits page of the IMDB page, and use that to call the next parse function.  It does this by creating a variable 'new_url', which is just the start_url with 'fullcredits' added on the end.  Then the function yields a Request object that calls the next function, 'parse_full_credits' with the new_url we obtained earlier.

```python
    def parse(self, response):
        """
        Directs scraper from movie/show page to its credits page
        """
        new_url = response.url + "fullcredits" # obtain credits page url
        yield Request(new_url, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
        # call parse_full_credits with new url
```

## ยง2. Analyze the Results
