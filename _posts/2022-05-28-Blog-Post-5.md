## ยง1. Main Page

We will start by showing how to create the overall flask web application and specifically the main page.  We start by creating the main code document, app.py, which will house our functions and all of the Python code we will use.  Below is the code used to create the project and the main page.  Here is a link to the GitHub repository:  https://github.com/NicholasDelianedis/HW5App

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, g
from flask import redirect, url_for, abort
import sqlite3
import os # import necessary items

app = Flask(__name__) # create flask
gidcount = 0 # create global id count for later

@app.route("/") # create main page
def main():
    return render_template('main.html') # render main template
```

So we start by importing all of the modules that we will need, including Flask, then create the app with Flask, and then define a function for the overall site where we render the template 'main.html'.  Now we will look at that template.

![Blog-5-main-html.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Blog-5-main-html.png)

The first line in this template refers to 'base.html', which, as we will see in a moment, sets up the navigation section on each page.  Then, we have our title in the block header, and the content in the block content, which in this case is just a welcome statement.  Now we will look at 'base.html'

![Blog-5-base.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Blog-5-base.png)

In this template, we have a statement stating the document type, html, then a head section which refers the application to the style sheet in the static folder, which we will come back to near the end of this blog post, and then the code for the navigation section, under the nav tag.  It contains the title, and links to the three main pages.  It also contains a section for the content of the page, which is filled in by the other templates for each page.

The main page, as constructed here, is shown below:

## ยง2. Submit Page

Next, we will show the submit page.  This page will accept submissions from users of their preferred handle, and a message from them.  Here is the code that implements this page from app.py:

```python
@app.route('/submit/', methods=['POST', 'GET']) # route to submit page
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET': # if user wants to retrieve page
        return render_template('submit.html') # render template
    else: # if user wants to submit a message
        try:
            insert_message(request) # try adding info to database and return database successfully

            return render_template('submit.html', thanks=True)
        except: # otherwise give an error message
            return render_template('submit.html', error=True)
```

This function routes the user to the submit page, and then renders the template based on the user's intent, with it rendering 'submit.html' each time, but giving different inputs also if the user successfully submits information, where the template will thank the user, and where it will give the user an error message if something goes wrong.  It also tries to run the insert_message function, which will be explained below.

```python
def insert_message(request):
    conn = get_message_db() # connect to database
    handle = request.form["name"] # get handle from form
    message = request.form["message"] # get message from form
    global gidcount # specify global gidcount from beginning
    gidcount += 1 # increment gidcount
    newid = gidcount # set newid to gidcount
    cmd = \
    '''
    INSERT INTO `messages`
    VALUES (?, ?, ?);
    ''' # sql command to insert into database
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(cmd, (newid, handle, message))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close() # close connection
```

This function inserts the message and handle into the database, where we use gidcount from above as a global id count, so that we can keep track of the number of responses outside of the function.  We get the database by calling the get_message_db function, which will be shown below, and then use sql commands to insert the id, handle, and message into the database, and finally commit the change and close the connection.

```python
def get_message_db():
    try: # try returning the database
        return g.message_db
    except: # if database does not exist, create it
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")
        cmd = \
        '''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `messages` (
            id int,
            handle varchar(255),
            message varchar(255)
            );
        '''
        cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
        cursor.execute(cmd) # sql command to create database
        return g.message_db
```

This function retrieves the database, and creates it if it does not exist using a sql command to create the table, and then to return the table in either case.  Now we will look at the 'submit.html' template, which we alluded to earlier, which handles the rest of the functionality of the submit page.

![Blog-5-submit-html.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Blog-5-submit-html.png)

This html template starts by rendering the title of 'Submit' at the top of the page, and then renders the form with the questions under the content block.  The form allows users to enter information into the two boxes, and saves them under request.form, with 'name' and 'message' being the two columns the information is saved under.  Then it also has if statements that give a thanks message if the template is called with the thanks variable set to True, and an error message if that variable is set to true.  Here is what the submit page looks like on the website:
