Tutorial on how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins dataset.

In this tutorial, we will show how to create a visualization of the Palmer Penguins dataset.  As an example, we will plot culmen depth and length, while coloring each point by penguin species.

### Loading Data

We start by loading the dataset into Python and importing the modules that we need.  We can do this by importing pandas so that we cna work with panel data, and plotly so that we can create a visually appealing plot, and reading the data from a csv file on the website as shown below.

```python 
import pandas as pd # import relevant modules
from plotly import express as px
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url) # read in dataset
```

### Cleaning Data

Next, we will clean the data a little bit.  To create this plot, all we will need to do is to rename the species column so that the species names will be readable on the graph.

```python
# clean species name by removing excess information
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```

### Creating Graph

Finally, we will create the graph.  To do this, we will employ the scatter function of plotly express, which will generate a scatter plot of our data.  The following code will take in the dataset, the desired axes, the specification for which variable is used to color the points, the opacity of the points, and the size of the graph.  Then the update_layout line will reduce the whitespace of the graph, and the last line will display the graph.

```python
fig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins, 
                # use penguins data
                 x = "Culmen Length (mm)",
                 # set x axis to culmen length
                 y = "Culmen Depth (mm)",
                 # set y axis to culmen depth
                 color = "Species",
                 # color each point by its species
                 opacity = 0.5
                 # each point at 50% opacity
                 width = 500,
                 height = 300) # size of graph

# remove whitespace
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})

fig.show()
```

### Final Result

Now, we can see the final result, shown below:
