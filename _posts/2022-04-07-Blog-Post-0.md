Tutorial on how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins dataset.

In this tutorial, we will show how to create a visualization of the Palmer Penguins dataset.  As an example, we will plot culmen depth and length, while coloring each point by penguin species.

### Loading Data

We start by loading the dataset into Python and importing the modules that we need.  We can do this by importing pandas so that we cna work with panel data, and plotly so that we can create a visually appealing plot, and reading the data from a csv file on the website as shown below.

```python 
import pandas as pd
from plotly import express as px
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

### Cleaning Data

Next, we will clean the data a little bit.  To create this plot, all we will need to do is to rename the species column so that the species names will be readable on the graph.

```python
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```

### Creating Graph

Finally, we will create the graph.  To do this, we will employ the scatter function of plotly express, which will generate a scatter plot of our data.  The following code will take in the dataset, the desired axes, the specification for which variable is used to color the points, the opacity of the points, and the size of the graph.  Then the update_layout line will reduce the whitespace of the graph, and the last line will display the graph.

```python
fig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins,
                 x = "Culmen Length (mm)",
                 y = "Culmen Depth (mm)",
                 color = "Species",
                 opacity = 0.5
                 width = 500,
                 height = 300)

fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})

fig.show()
```

### Final Result

Now, we can see the final result, shown below:
