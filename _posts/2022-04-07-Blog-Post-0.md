Tutorial on how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins dataset.

### Loading Data

We start by loading the dataset into Python and importing the modules that we need.  We can do this by importing pandas so that we cna work with panel data, and plotly so that we can create a visually appealing plot, and reading the data from a csv file on the website as shown below.

```python 
import pandas as pd
from plotly import express as px
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
